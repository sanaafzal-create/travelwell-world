/**
 * Emit the repository's ground truth — every count, field path and vocabulary
 * READ FROM THE SOURCE, with the file and line each one came from.
 *
 *   npm run gen:ground-truth   → docs/ground-truth.md
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-12). A planning surface with no access to this
 * repository produced a spec built on remembered field names: "booking windows
 * are in §6 of the nineteen sections." The dossier is nine layers, booking
 * windows are layer 4a, and no interest carries a dossier at all — so an
 * inheritance plan for 211 items had nothing to inherit from. None of that was
 * arguable; it was all one lookup away. The lookup just never happened, and
 * from the inside a confident recollection is indistinguishable from a read.
 *
 * So the fix isn't a promise to check more carefully. It's making the check a
 * command anyone can run and paste. This file is the artifact you hand to a
 * surface that can't read the repo — and because it is generated, it cannot
 * quietly drift from the code the way a hand-kept fact sheet does. A fact sheet
 * that goes stale is worse than none: it launders a stale claim as a verified
 * one.
 *
 * The conformance section is the important half. Counts answer "how many";
 * conformance answers "does the data actually obey the rule we wrote down",
 * which is the question a spec is really asking when it assumes a shape.

const md = `# Ground truth — generated, do not hand-edit

*Generated by \`npm run gen:ground-truth\`. Every number and field path below is
read from the source at generation time.*

**What this is for.** Hand it to anyone — or anything — that needs to reason
about this codebase without being able to read it. A spec built on a remembered
field name is bad work, and the remedy is not more care: it is a lookup that
costs one command. Because this file is generated, it cannot drift from the code
the way a hand-kept fact sheet does, and a fact sheet that has gone stale is
worse than none — it launders a stale claim as a verified one.

**How to use it in a review.** Take each factual claim in the spec — a field
name, a section number, a count, a file path — and find it here. Anything you
cannot find is unverified, which is not the same as wrong, but it is the same as
not-yet-checkable. Say so rather than letting it through.

**Citations carry an anchor, not just a line number.** Every \`file:line\` below is
followed by the source text it points at. Line numbers rot silently — insert one
line above and the number points elsewhere while still looking precise — so grep
the anchor and ignore the number if the two disagree. Regenerating fixes both.

**You can read this file instead of running it.** A pre-commit hook re-runs every
generator and refuses the commit if any generated file is out of step, so the
committed copy cannot be behind the source it describes. Reading it at HEAD is as
good as regenerating it.

## The Signature-Interest dossier — NINE layers

Defined by \`SiData\` at ${lineOf(TAX, /export interface SiData/)}. There is no
nineteen-section structure in this repository.

| Layer | Field path | Type |
|---|---|---|
${rows(LAYERS.map(([n, f, t]) => [n, f.split(" · ").map((k) => `\`data.${k}\``).join(" · "), `\`${t}\``]))}

**Booking windows are layer 4a**, at \`data.timing.booking_window\`
(${lineOf(TAX, /booking_window\?/)}), typed \`string\`. Layer 6 is \`providers\`.

**Every figure carries its own confidence.** \`Figure\` is
\`{label, value, confidence, source?}\` with \`confidence\` REQUIRED
(${lineOf(TAX, /export interface Figure/)}); \`verified\` without a \`source\` is a
hard error in \`npm run validate:si\`. An unlabeled number is a guessed number.

## Live roster

**Interests at \`status: live\` (${live.length}):** ${live.map((s) => `\`${s.id}\``).join(" · ")}
— \`ultra\` is the luxury overlay, not a trip type, so the bookable set is ${live.length - 1}.

**Wells live (${allWells.filter((w) => w.status === "live").length}):** ${allWells.filter((w) => w.status === "live").map((w) => w.name).join(" · ")}
**Not live (${allWells.filter((w) => w.status !== "live").length}):** ${allWells.filter((w) => w.status !== "live").map((w) => w.name).join(" · ")}

## Canonical vocabularies — as typed, not as remembered

| Vocabulary | Values | Read from |
|---|---|---|
${rows([
  ["Budget tier (\`price\`)", "`essential` · `comfort` · `premier` · `luxury` · `ultra`", lineOf(PLACES, /export type Price/)],
  ["Provider curation (\`tier\`)", "`prime` · `vetted` · `prospective`", lineOf(PLACES, /export type Tier/)],
  ["Interest status", "`live` · `preview` · `soon`", lineOf(TAX, /export type Status/)],
  ["Destination status", "`live` · `future`", lineOf(PLACES, /export type DestStatus/)],
  ["Destination depth", "`verified` · `stub` · `cached`", lineOf(PLACES, /export type DestDepth/)],
  ["Booking path", "`api` · `request-to-book` · `aggregator` · `lead`", lineOf(TAX, /export type BookingPath/)],
])}

Budget tier and provider curation are **different axes** that both get called
"tier" in conversation. \`price\` is what it costs; \`tier\` is how well we know
the provider.

## Conformance — does the data obey the rules?

${checks.map((c) => `${tick(c.ok)} **${c.rule}**\n   → ${c.result}\n   → \`${c.where}\``).join("\n\n")}

*Scope note on the safety check: it covers the countries we serve **today**. An
incoming dossier can name a country with no row yet — the Philippines has none —
and that surfaces at \`npm run validate:ingest\`, not here. A green tick above is
not a claim about countries we haven't ingested.*

## What is NOT populated yet

Stating this explicitly because an empty structure and a filled one look
identical in a schema, and a plan that assumes inheritance needs to know which
it is.

- **${SIS.filter((s) => s.data && Object.keys(s.data).length).length} of ${SIS.length} interests carry a dossier.** The only \`booking_window\` value in the repo is inside \`src/data/interests/_REFERENCE.golf.json\`, which is \`_\`-prefixed and never ships. **There is nothing to inherit booking windows from.**
- **${dests.filter((d) => d.price_band).length} of ${dests.length} destinations carry a \`price_band\`.**
- **${dests.filter((d) => d.feel?.length).length} of ${dests.length} destinations carry \`feel\` tags.**
- **${dests.filter((d) => d.sub_region).length} of ${dests.length} destinations carry a \`sub_region\`.**
- **${shipping(dossierFiles.destinations).length} shipping destination dossier file(s)** and **${shipping(dossierFiles.interests).length} shipping interest dossier file(s)** in the drop-in folders.

## Exact-match strings — the characters that bounce a batch

Every string below is compared **character for character** by a gate. Each one
contains a character an editor, a word processor or an email client can silently
replace: a curly quote for a straight one, an em dash for a hyphen, an accent
stripped. A mismatch is a hard error, and it doesn't fail one row — it bounces
the batch.

**Match the codepoint, not the glyph.** \`'\` (U+0027) and \`’\` (U+2019) are
indistinguishable at reading size and are different bytes. So is \`‘\` (U+2018).
Copy these from this file, which is generated from the source, rather than from
an email — mail clients smart-quote, which is how a correct string arrives wrong.

| Where | String | The character to watch |
|---|---|---|
${(() => {
  const rows: string[][] = [];
  const nonAscii = (s: string) => [...s].filter((c) => c.charCodeAt(0) > 127 || c === "'");
  const cp = (c: string) => `U+${c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase().padStart(4, "0")} \`${c}\``;
  for (const [code, list] of Object.entries(SUBREGIONS as Record<string, string[]>)) {
    for (const s of list) if (nonAscii(s).length) rows.push([`sub_region ${code}`, `\`${s}\``, nonAscii(s).map(cp).join(" · ")]);
  }
  for (const s of [...new Set(dests.map((d) => d.sub_region).filter(Boolean))] as string[]) {
    if (nonAscii(s).length) rows.push(["live `sub_region`", `\`${s}\``, nonAscii(s).map(cp).join(" · ")]);
  }
  for (const d of dests) {
    if (nonAscii(d.name).length) rows.push(["destination `name`", `\`${d.name}\``, nonAscii(d.name).map(cp).join(" · ")]);
  }
  return rows.map((r) => `| ${r.join(" | ")} |`).join("\n");
})()}

*\`Hawai‘i\` uses U+2018, a left single quotation mark. The Hawaiian ʻokina is
properly U+02BB — so if the canonical master spells it with the ʻokina, our
validated string and the master disagree and one of them has to move. Flagged
rather than changed: these strings come verbatim from the master.*

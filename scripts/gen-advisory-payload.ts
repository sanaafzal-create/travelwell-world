/**
 * Emit the country payload the daily checker is called with — AND the scheduled
 * job that carries it, from the same run.
 *
 * The Edge Function deliberately never guesses its own country list — it checks
 * what we actually SERVE, which is why the cycle is ~90 lookups and not 200, and
 * why a country appearing on the site can't quietly go unchecked. The list is
 * therefore an input, generated from the same tables the site renders from:
 * `COUNTRY_ISO` for the countries, `advisory-sources.ts` for the FCDO slugs.
 *
 *   npm run gen:advisory-payload   → docs/advisory-countries.json
 *                                  → supabase/migrations/0015_advisory_schedule.sql
 *
 * The migration is emitted here rather than hand-kept for one reason: the payload
 * the job actually sends and the payload in the repo have to be the same bytes.
 * Regenerating the list without updating the job is a silent gap — the checker
 * stops covering a country while still reporting a clean run, which is the worst
 * shape a failure can take, because the number at the end still looks right.
 * Generating both from one command makes that drift impossible rather than
 * merely documented against. Re-run the migration after any regeneration; it is
 * idempotent (it unschedules the old job before scheduling the new one).

/**
 * ── THE LIST IS DERIVED FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HOLD, WHICH CLOSES A LOOP ──────
 * The header above says a country appearing on the site cannot quietly go
 * unchecked. It reads `COUNTRY_ISO`, which is the countries we already have a
 * safety row for — not the countries we actually serve. Those are different sets
 * and the difference is 45 countries behind 230 destinations, measured
 * 2026-08-18 (David asked for the number and said nobody had counted it).
 *
 * The loop: a country with no safety row is absent from COUNTRY_ISO, so it is
 * absent from this payload, so the daily checker never reads it, so no reading
 * ever arrives that would justify creating the row. Unchecked because it has no
 * row; no row because it is unchecked. It cannot self-heal, and every run reports
 * a clean 39 of 39 while 46% of the catalog goes unread.
 *
 * Adding those 45 needs an ISO code each, and this repo's standing rule is that a
 * country-code map is never hand-written from memory — the failure mode is a
 * silent join to the wrong country's advisory, which is the exact defect the
 * FIPS/ISO note warns about. So this does NOT invent them. It makes the omission
 * loud instead of silent, and records it in the emitted file so the gap is
 * auditable rather than merely absent.

/**
 * TravelWell — the living Travel ID (David-locked: Identity Builder + Lifetime Loop).
 *
 * The Identity Card is the traveler's PERMANENT anchor — the *constant* (who they
 * are: name, age cohort, party, how they move, budget style per Well, interests).
 * The trip *vision* is the *variable* — it changes every trip and is NOT identity;
 * it's held as `trip_intent` and re-asked each Lifetime-Loop check-in.
 *
 * This module normalizes a stored `TravelIdRecord` (or the demo fallback) into a
 * display-ready shape, and holds the canonical age-cohort + budget vocabularies so
 * the card renders real data instead of a hardcoded mock. See
 * docs/identity-builder-and-age-budget.md.

 * Age shapes pace/tone/mobility, NEVER budget (separate axis, locked). Stored as a
 * range, never a birthday. `cohortFor` also accepts the legacy Sign-Up buckets so
 * older Travel IDs keep rendering while onboarding catches up to the 12-cohort set. */
/**
 * `note` is the compact line — used where there is room for one clause (a party

 * themselves in it before choosing.
 *
 * ── STEPS, AND WHY THEY SIT UNDER THE RANGE ───────────────────────────────
 * About 2,100–2,250 steps to the mile, so three miles is roughly 6,500. The
 * count is there because a great many people over sixty already track it daily
 * and recognise themselves in it instantly — faster than any adjective.
 *
 * ⛔ Pace shapes distance, rest and timing. It NEVER shapes budget — that is a
 * separate axis, set per Well, and the separation is locked.

/**
 * TravelWell.World — voice seam types (the "belt + slots" contract).
 *
 * VOICE = ADAPTER SEAM (David-locked): the app talks to THIS interface only —
 * never to a vendor. One belt holds two swappable slots, mouth (TTS) and ears
 * (STT); swapping a slot is a one-line change in the factory, never an app edit.
 * Today: browser Web Speech. Tomorrow: LiveKit belt + Cartesia mouth + Deepgram
 * ears drop in behind the same three interfaces. The brain (Claude in our edge
 * function) is never inside a vendor's agent format — that's the welded box we
 * refuse.
 *
 * On-screen text is always the guaranteed fallback (WCAG AA + dialect safety
 * net): the mirror shows Atlas's whole answer while he speaks it.

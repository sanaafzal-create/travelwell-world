/**
 * Affiliate redirect interstitial — straight handoff + "mark as booked" return.
 *
 * AND THE SAFETY CHOKEPOINT. `/go` is the single door out to a partner, which
 * makes it the one place a safety rule can be enforced once instead of on every
 * booking control. Gating buttons does not hold: they multiply, and one gets
 * missed — which is exactly what happened with Level 4, where the safety card
 * said "not bookable" while every Book It button below it stayed live.
 *
 * `?dest=<id>` carries WHICH destination is being booked. Without it this page
 * knows a provider and a Well and nothing about where in the world the traveller
 * is going, so it cannot look up an advisory even in principle.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, stated because it matters more than the code: no caller supplies
 * `dest` yet. `WellsSurface` and `Providers` are Well- and region-scoped and
 * genuinely don't know a destination, and the destination page's Book It opens
 * Atlas rather than routing through here. So today this is a capability with one
 * live consumer — a hand-built or shared link — not yet a gate across the
 * product. Making it one means deciding whether destination-originated bookings
 * should route through `/go`, which is a product call, not plumbing.
 *
 * TWO RULES ARE ENFORCED HERE, and the difference between them is the point.
 * LEVEL 4 NEVER BOOKS — no consent override, no way to agree past it (David,
 * 2026-08-05). LEVEL 3 BOOKS ONLY AFTER AN INFORMED CHOICE: the traveller is
 * shown the advisory in its own words and picks, with the alternatives option
 * holding focus. One is a refusal, the other is a gate; conflating them would
 * either sell a Do-Not-Travel trip or refuse a bookable one.

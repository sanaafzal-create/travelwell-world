/**
 * TravelWell.World — Catalog store (the dynamic read-layer for components).
 *
 * Seeded synchronously from the bundled taxonomy, so the first render is
 * instant and works fully offline (the bundle is the fallback). On app boot
 * `hydrate()` pulls the catalog from Postgres and, per entity, folds in
 * whatever the DB supplies: DB rows win on conflict, bundle entries fill any
 * gaps — so we never lose shipped content, and catalog rows added or edited in
 * the DB show up after a refresh without a redeploy.
 *
 * Components read the catalog through this store (the use* hooks) instead of
 * importing the bundle directly, so the swap to DB-served content is invisible
 * to them. Bundle order is preserved (it drives grouped/ordered display);
 * DB-only entries are appended.
 *
 * Non-React callers (e.g. lib/journey.ts) keep using the bundle helpers in
 * src/data — they only need stable lookups (a well's icon) and run before
 * hydration; the bundle is the correct source there.

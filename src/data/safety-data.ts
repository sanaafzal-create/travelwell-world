/**
 * TravelWell — Safety Card data (the layer behind the Destination Safety Card).
 *
 * Self-contained, framework-free, no network — compiled into the bundle, the
 * same pattern as src/data/emergency-numbers.ts. Keyed by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
 * country code so it JOINS the emergency-numbers data off one key (local
 * emergency phone lines live there, never duplicated here).
 *
 * Accuracy contract: every entry must carry a real `source` + `verified` date.
 * Entries we haven't verified yet fall through to DEFAULT_SAFETY ("exercise
 * normal precautions"), which the card renders as a neutral, accurate baseline.
 *
 * Hand-off (David): author entries in this shape (TS or matching JSON), keyed
 * by ISO code, no phone numbers, with source + verified on every entry.

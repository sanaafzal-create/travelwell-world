 * ── Why the citation travels WITH the jewel (David's decision 1, 2026-08-12) ──
 * He asked whether `source` belongs on the jewel or lives elsewhere and gets
 * joined. It has to travel with it, and the reason is the interest page: a jewel
 * shown on `/interest/liveaboard` has been lifted out of its destination dossier,
 * away from the file's prose and away from that dossier's FAQ. Whatever cited it
 * there is no longer on the page. An answer engine can only cite what carries its
 * own provenance, and a joined citation is one refactor away from being dropped
 * on exactly the surface where it matters most.
 *
 * `accessed` is separate from `source` on purpose. A URL says where the claim
 * came from; a date says when we last looked. A price or an opening time with no
 * date attached is a claim we are making today about a page we may have read a
 * year ago — which is the same failure as a "Verified" badge over an unverified
 * safety row, wearing different clothes.

/**
 * OLD ID → NEW ID. The destination key is `<city>-<country>` (canon), and 34 of
 * the 44 rows predated that rule: `paris`, `kruger`, `gbr`, `machu`. Renamed
 * 2026-08-12 against `docs/live-row-reconcile-map.md`, which already carried the
 * agreed target for every row — the targets are not invented here.
 *
 * THE OLD IDS DO NOT DIE, for three reasons, and each would bite on its own:
 *
 *  1. **Saved trips.** A traveler's stored itinerary holds destination ids. A
 *     rename without aliasing silently empties their trip, and `findDestination`
 *     falls back to the FIRST destination in East Africa rather than erroring —
 *     so they'd get a confidently wrong page, not a missing one.
 *  2. **Shared and indexed URLs.** `/destination/paris` has been out in the
 *     world. It resolves.
 *  3. **`reconciles_live_mvp`.** Library dossiers link to a live row by its
 *     CURRENT slug, and the ingest validator hard-errors on a value that isn't a
 *     live MVP id. Every dossier already authored against `kruger` would fail
 *     the gate the moment we renamed the row. Aliasing keeps that linkage
 *     working — which is the whole point of the reconcile map.
 *
 * So this map is permanent, not a migration aid to delete later.

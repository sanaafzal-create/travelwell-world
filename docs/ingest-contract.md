# The ingest contract — LOCKED

*David's three questions, answered so nothing gets reshaped again. Sana, 2026-08.*

The short version: **drop a JSON file in `src/data/destinations/`, run the
validator, open a PR.** No hand-merging, no reshaping, no touching `places.ts`.

---

## 1. The gold reference destination

**`src/data/destinations/_REFERENCE.example.json`** — one destination with every
field populated: the full row *plus* a complete `data` object (safety, timing,
jewels with commission + si, faq, seo, booking, geo). Match it byte-for-byte.

Files beginning with `_` are ignored by the generator, so the reference can live
in the real folder without ever shipping as a row. **Strip every `_comment` key
from real batches.**

Notes on the fields that matter most:
- **`faq`** is `{ q, a, source }` and feeds FAQPage structured data — it's the
  block AI answer engines quote. Highest-value field in the file.
- **`jewels[]`** each want **`si`** (which interest it serves) and **`commission`**
  (the earning lane) wherever the jewel is bookable. That's the money.
- **`seo`** — include it. Note it can't take effect until server-rendering ships
  (a client-rendered page can't vary its meta per route), but it costs nothing to
  carry and will be live the day that lands.
- **`reconciles_live_mvp`** — only for the 45 places already live in the MVP; see
  `docs/live-row-reconcile-map.md`. Everything else is net-new and needs no linkage.

## 2. The handoff — drop-in JSON, one file per batch

**Deliver:** `src/data/destinations/<batch-name>.json` — e.g.
`dive-liveaboard.json`, `alpine.json`. **`data` is inline**, one object per
destination. No separate files, no rows authored into `places.ts`.

**Format:** either a flat array (each row carrying `region_code`), or an object
keyed by region code. Both work — pick whichever your generator emits naturally.

**Deliver as a PR.** The generator picks the file up automatically — the same
"add a file and it works" path providers already have — so there is nothing on
my side to reshape or hand-merge.

**Collision rule:** a batch row with the same `id` as an existing row **wins and
replaces it.** That's deliberate: it's how a shallow hand-authored anchor
(Zermatt, Cape Town) gets upgraded by its full dossier without creating a
duplicate.

**Before you send, run:**
```bash
npm run validate:ingest -- src/data/destinations/<batch-name>.json
```
Green (`✓ Clean against live canon — safe to ingest`) means it drops straight in.
Red prints exactly what to fix — region codes, id format, non-canonical spellings,
jewel/FAQ shape, and every cross-reference resolved. Iterate until green.

Then on my side it's one command and a re-run of the migration:
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/esbuild scripts/gen-catalog-seed.ts --bundle --platform=node \
  --format=esm --outfile=scratchpad/gen.mjs && node scratchpad/gen.mjs
```

## 2b. The `img` token — answered (it barely matters)

**`img` is only the instant placeholder.** Destination heroes and cards fetch the
real, matched photo from Unsplash using `"{name}, {country}"` and swap it in; the
token is what shows for the moment before that resolves (and if Unsplash is
unavailable). So it does **not** need to be a real picture of the place.

**You can use any of these 20 tokens, or omit `img` entirely:**
`safariGiraffe · lion · safariJeep · elephant · tropicalBeach · oceanAerial ·
maldivesResort · mountainValley · desertDunes · northernLights · baliRice · paris ·
venice · marrakech · dubai · kyoto · santorini · restaurant · spaWellness · luxuryPool`

Pick the nearest vibe (a dive site → `oceanAerial`, an alpine resort →
`mountainValley`). **Omitting it is fine** — the generator supplies a default.

*Previously an unrecognised token rendered an empty `<img>` src. It now falls back
to a neutral image, so a token we've never seen can't break a page. That was worth
catching before 36 dive destinations arrived with tokens none of which existed.*

### The editorial hero override — your pick wins (no API key needed)

You asked to take hero images off Sana's plate. You can, **without anyone
handing out the Unsplash key** (which we don't send by email — the repo is
public and an emailed key is a key we no longer control). Put it in the dossier:

```jsonc
"hero": { "query": "Cape Town Table Mountain aerial" }        // steer the auto-search
"hero": { "url": "https://…/photo.jpg",                        // OR pin an exact image
          "credit": { "name": "Photographer", "link": "https://…" } }
```

**Precedence: `hero.url` > `hero.query` > automatic `"{name}, {country}"`.**
Omit `hero` entirely and nothing changes — the page fetches its own matched photo
as it does today.

Two rules the validator enforces: **`url` must be https** (an http image breaks on
a secure page), and if it's an Unsplash photo **include `credit`** — their licence
requires photographer attribution, which the automatic path gets for free but a
pinned one can't. We display the credit, and we only say "/ Unsplash" when it
actually is one.

## 3. The 30-second confirm

**Is `main` stable?** Yes. The destination schema hasn't changed since 2026-07-10
and nothing is mid-change on it. The `data` jsonb, `si[]`, `feel[]`,
`tier_range[]`, `price_band`, `draw_rank`, `depth`, `sub_region` are all live in
production. Build against `main` with confidence.

**Level-4 content-holds — use `status: "live"`, `depth: "verified"`.**

That surprises people, so the reasoning: `status` and `depth` describe the
*content*, not its bookability. An L4 dossier is a real, finished, live page — we
want it served, indexed and read; we just don't want a Book button on it. So:

| field | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `"live"` | the page exists and should be served (`future` = not shown at all) |
| `depth` | `"verified"` | it's a full dossier, not a stub |
| `data.safety.advisory_level` | `"L4"` | **this** is what drives suppression |
| `data.safety.booking_hold` | `true` | explicit — the validator warns if L4 lacks it |

Keeping suppression in the safety layer rather than in `status` is deliberate: it
means an advisory can change daily without anyone re-editing the dossier, which is
exactly what the live-advisory system needs.

### The cascade — and your carve-out now actually renders

Country advisory is the baseline; a dossier's own `data.safety.advisory_level`
**overrides it for that destination**. This is what a named-zone carve-out is: the
FCDO's 7 km volcanic exclusion on Flores, which State doesn't carry, belongs on
the Komodo dossier, not in the country record.

*Until 2026-08-10 the page read only the country level, so a carve-out validated,
stored, and then displayed the country's number anyway. It's wired now.*

Two behaviours worth knowing when you author one:
- **A carve-out that differs from its country is labelled as such on the card** —
  it names the country-wide level too. A traveler who just read the government
  page and sees a different number here needs to know which is which.
- **`booking_hold: true` (or `L4`, which implies it) prints a plain line saying we
  won't sell a trip there.** The page stays; the sale doesn't.

A dossier that carries `data.safety` with **notes but no `advisory_level`** is
treated as enrichment, not a carve-out — the note is added to the country card
rather than replacing its level.

### 3b. Named zones — the shape a country's sub-country advisory goes in

**This is the answer to "what shape do you want the Philippines row in."** Send a
country row, and put every named area with a level attached in `zones[]`.

Some advisories are *mostly* zones. The Philippines is Level 2 with a Level 4
archipelago, a Level 4 city and a Level 3 island inside it — and four named
places carved back out of that Level 3 to the country baseline. The country
number alone tells a traveler almost nothing true.

Until 2026-08-17 those areas were **prose**, inside `considerations`:

> `Level 4 "Do Not Travel" zones: the VRAEM (Apurimac/Ene/Mantaro valley) and the Colombia-border area of Loreto.`

That renders correctly and reads well, and **no code can see it.** The booking
gate reads `lvl`, which is the country number, so a destination inside a
Do-Not-Travel zone would have shown its country's Level 2 and offered a Book
button. Ten of thirty-six country rows were carrying zones this way. Nothing was
wrong live only because all 44 live destinations sit in the mainstream part of
their country — luck, not a gate. All ten are now structured, and
`npm run gen:ground-truth` fails if a level claim goes back into prose.

**On the country row** (`src/data/safety.json`):

```jsonc
"PH": {
  "country": "Philippines", "lvl": 2, "label": "Exercise increased caution",
  "summary": "…",
  "considerations": ["Reissued 8 May 2025 with a Kidnapping indicator.", "…"],
  "zones": [
    { "name": "The Sulu Archipelago, including the southern Sulu Sea", "lvl": 4 },
    { "name": "Marawi City, Mindanao", "lvl": 4 },
    { "name": "Mindanao", "lvl": 3,
      "except": ["Davao City", "Davao del Norte", "Siargao Island", "The Dinagat Islands"],
      "note": "The remainder of Mindanao. The four named exceptions sit at the country baseline." }
  ],
  "source": "US State Dept L2, reissued 8 May 2025 / UK FCDO, reissued 1 Apr 2026",
  "verified": "2026-08"
}
```

`except` is not decoration. Dropping it holds four bookable places at Level 3 —
an over-restriction is still an inaccuracy, and it is one that costs us bookings
we are entitled to take.

**On a destination dossier**, name the zone instead of restating its level:

```jsonc
"data": { "safety": { "zone": "The Sulu Archipelago, including the southern Sulu Sea",
                      "advisory_level": "L4", "booking_hold": true, "posture": "content-only" } }
```

Four rules, so this can't drift:
- **The zone name is the join key and the match is exact** (case and whitespace
  aside). Not the destination's name, not its `sub_region` — fuzzy geography is
  how a place silently inherits the wrong advisory, and a safety read is the last
  place to be clever. `npm run validate:ingest` **rejects a name that doesn't
  join** and prints the country's known zones, so a near miss is a one-line fix.
- **The level lives on the country row, once.** When State moves the Sulu
  Archipelago, one row changes and every destination in it follows. Copies would
  have to be found.
- **If a dossier declares both a `zone` and an `advisory_level` and they
  disagree, the stricter wins** — of the two possible mistakes, refusing a
  bookable place and selling a held one, only the second can't be taken back.
- **An unresolvable zone fails safe at runtime too**: no level printed, booking
  held. The gate should catch it first; this is what happens if one slips past.

The card shows the zones a traveler needs: the one this destination is *in*
(named, so the level is checkable against the advisory they're about to open),
and the rest of the country's stricter areas below the considerations.

**The same gap elsewhere:** every country in `COUNTRY_ISO` now has a baseline
row. Ethiopia was the one exception — in the daily checker's payload with nothing
to compare against — and it was **closed on 2026-08-17 from State's own feed**
(L3, with thirteen L4 regions). `docs/ground-truth.md` runs 15 checks with none
failing. **There is no outstanding country-row ask.**

*Left here as a worked example of the shape, not as a request. If you are reading
this to find out what to send, the answer is nothing — check `ground-truth.md`,
which is generated and cannot go stale the way this sentence just did.*

### 3c. Jewels — the citation travels with the jewel

`source` and `accessed` are now fields on a jewel, and the reason is where a
jewel ends up rather than where it is authored.

Jewels are authored inside a **destination** dossier. They now also render on the
**interest** page — gathered by the jewel's own `si` tag, across every live
destination (`/si/ski` shows seven, from five destinations). That is the query
most people actually arrive with: they want the experiences, not a list of
countries.

On that page the jewel has left its dossier behind. The file's prose isn't there,
the dossier's FAQ isn't there, and whatever cited the claim isn't there either.
So the citation has to be on the jewel:

```jsonc
{ "name": "The Sellaronda circuit in a day", "tier": "premier",
  "when": "clear midweek days", "si": "ski",
  "blurb": "…one lift pass — 40km of pistes, four valleys…",
  "commission": "Dolomiti Superski lane",
  "source": "https://www.dolomitisuperski.com/…",   // or a named publisher
  "accessed": "2026-08" }                            // YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD
```

- **`source` is where the claim came from. `accessed` is when we last read it.**
  Separate on purpose: a figure with no date is a claim we're making today about
  a page we may have read a year ago. `accessed` without `source` is an error —
  a date we read nothing on is not provenance.
- **Not every jewel needs one.** "The Matterhorn head-on, before the crowds" is
  editorial, and demanding a citation for taste produces fake ones. The gate
  warns only when a jewel states a **checkable figure** — money, a distance, a
  duration, a clock time, a percentage. It ignores seasons and month ranges.
- **The card shows what we hold.** A jewel with a source prints it; a jewel
  without gets no line, and the section carries one footnote saying unsourced
  cards are our own editorial picks. A disclaimer repeated on every card stops
  being read; the point is that a reader can tell the two apart at a glance.
- **Each jewel emits `TouristAttraction` structured data**, on both the
  destination and the interest page, with its containing place, its `when` as
  `temporalCoverage`, and its source as `isBasedOn`. It's `TouristAttraction`
  rather than `Event` because a jewel's *when* is a condition, not a date, and
  faking a `startDate` to satisfy the schema would put a wrong fact in the
  machine-readable layer to make that layer look complete.
- **It's in the served HTML, not just injected by JavaScript** — the same route
  as the Organization record, via `gen-static-heads`. The canonical URL on a
  jewel is always its **destination** page, so an interest that surfaces it
  doesn't claim to be its home.

### The traveler's own check — deep links, not a gesture

Every destination page now names the sources, publishes our verification date,
and links **to that country's page** on State, the FCDO and the CDC. Slugs live in
`src/data/advisory-sources.ts`; where we have no confirmed slug the link falls
back to that source's index and says so on the page, because a deep link that
404s reads as "we checked" when we didn't.

**`npm run check:advisory-links` fetches every generated URL and reports what
resolves.** It needs outbound network — run it from an environment that has some,
and fix any slug it flags in that one file.

## 4. Special-Interest dossiers — the nine layers, locked

*Added 2026-08-09, from David & Claude's "How we build & showcase every Special
Interest" note. Same discipline as destinations: a shape, a folder, a gate.*

The nine layers **are** the schema. One key per layer, in David's order, in the
`special_interests.data` jsonb (migration 0012, live in production):

| # | Layer | Key |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The market — sized and range-cited | `market` |
| 2 | Demand streams (play vs watch) | `streams` |
| 3 | Source countries — the targeting map | `sources` |
| 4 | Seasons + booking windows / the event look-ahead | `timing` / `events` |
| 5 | The global map | `map` |
| 6 | The money and the booking rails | `providers` |
| 7 | Traveler Q&A | `faq` |
| 8 | Connective tissue — Wells, whispers, safety | `wells` / `whispers` / `safety` |
| 9 | Ship-ready — SEO/GEO + schema | `seo` / `schema` |

**Every layer is optional.** A dossier can land in stages and the page renders
whatever is present — it never shows an empty shelf. Extra keys pass straight
through the jsonb, so a later pass needs no migration.

### The one hard rule: no unlabeled numbers

Every figure is `{ label, value, confidence, source? }`, and **`confidence` is
required** — `verified` or `estimate`. The gate rejects an unlabeled number,
because an unlabeled number is a guessed number, and a guessed number is the one
mistake this whole system exists to make impossible.

`verified` **also requires a `source`.** Verified means someone can check it. If
the citing firm isn't pinned down yet, the figure is an `estimate` until it is —
that's the rule working, not a gap. (The gold reference deliberately shows both:
the US figures name NGF and are verified; the Korea/Japan/Germany figures came
without a named firm and are carried as estimates.)

`value` is a **string** on purpose — the real research carries ranges, arrows and
currencies (`"$26B → $60B"`, `"€2,041/trip"`) that a numeric column would flatten.

### The handoff

**Gold reference:** `src/data/interests/_REFERENCE.golf.json` — Golf Globally,
every layer populated, from the anatomy showcase. `_`-prefixed files are ignored
by the generator, so it lives in the real folder without ever shipping.

**Deliver:** `src/data/interests/<batch>.json` — an array, or
`{ "special_interests": [ … ] }`. Drop the file in, open a PR; the generator
picks it up automatically.

**Merge rule — differs from destinations, on purpose.** An SI batch row is
**shallow-merged** onto the bundled row, not a straight replace. The common case
is a dossier that only adds `data` to an interest that already exists, and a
replace would blank its name, accent and status. So a **data-only patch is
valid**: `{ "id": "safari", "data": { … } }` and nothing else. A **net-new**
interest must bring the full row (`name`, `sig`, `status`, `accent`, `group`).

**Before you send:**
```bash
npm run validate:si -- src/data/interests/<batch>.json
```

What it checks beyond the figures rule: status/accent/group shape · events are
absolute dated series (`year` or ISO `starts_on` — never "season", and a `year`
that disagrees with its `starts_on` is an error) · `booking_path` is one of
`api | request-to-book | aggregator | lead` (the API-first check) · `well` and
`map.regions` resolve to live canon · **`map.destinations` resolve to real MVP
destination ids** (a name pointing at nothing is a broken shelf) · FAQ has both
q and a.

### What renders today

`timing`, `events` and `faq` render on the SI page now, and `faq` + dated
`events` emit `FAQPage` / `Event` JSON-LD alongside `TouristTrip` — the layer-9
manifest, made real. A **preview** interest with a dossier shows its depth too
(content-only, no Book button — the same rule as an L4 destination).

`market`, `streams` and `sources` land in the jsonb now and are read by the
investor surface, not the traveler's page — a $26B market figure isn't something
a honeymooner needs on a hero.

**One field worth not forgetting:** `tagline_subject`. Without it the brand line
falls back to the full name — *"If It's Golf Globally… TravelWell™"* instead of
*"If It's Golf… TravelWell™"*. A tight noun. English-only; the slogan never
localizes. David's hand-locked map in `taxonomy.ts` still overrides it.

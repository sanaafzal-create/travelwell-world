# The TravelWell slogan family — in active use

*Generated from the live taxonomy by `scripts/gen-tagline-list.ts`. Content
last changed 2026-10-06. Do not hand-edit — regenerate.*

**The construction:** `If It's [X]… TravelWell.™`

The subject `[X]` varies; the closing brand mark never does. The mark is one
word, always, and the ellipsis and closing full stop are part of it — and the line is English-only in every market — it is a coined brand
line, not copy, so it is not translated (the same rule as the "-Well" family).

Rendered by one component (`Tagline` in `src/components/ui/primitives.tsx`), so
every instance on the site is the same construction by build, not by convention.

## Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| Distinct variants in active use | **38** |
| — master | 1 |
| — category (Safer Informed Travel) | 1 |
| — special-interest subjects | 36 (8 on live interests, 28 on preview interests) |
| Closing mark, every variant | `TravelWell.™` |

## 1. The master variant

> **If It's Travel… TravelWell.™**

In use site-wide: the home page, the mega-menu feature panel, the site footer,
and the Special-Interests master page.

## 2. The category variant

> **If It's Safer Informed Travel… TravelWell.™**

The Safer-Informed positioning line. Also carried in the concierge's own voice
instructions, so it is used in conversation as well as in page copy.

## 3. The special-interest variants

One per interest, rendered on that interest's page and on its card on the home
page. **Live interests** are in commerce now; **preview interests** render the
line on a published page that is not yet bookable.

## Notes for the file

- **The mark is one word in every variant.** A two-word "Travel Well" is not
  used as the brand anywhere on the site.
- **Some subjects are deliberately not the interest's full name** — `romance`
  renders "Love", `ski` renders "Winter", `liveaboard` renders "Liveaboards".
  Those short forms are the ones in commerce, and they are the ones this list
  records.
- **Subjects marked "falls back to full name"** have no short form set yet; the
  line still renders, using the interest's full name as `[X]`.
- The count grows as the interest board grows. Regenerate before filing.

// TravelWell.World — the daily advisory checker (David's verification cycle).
//
// ONE checker, run DAILY. It surfaces the moment something moves — IN EITHER
// DIRECTION — and writes everything to an audit log; the 1st and the 15th are
// when we PUBLISH, not when we check. A separate "urgent path" was the
// alternative and it doubles the failure surface — the half that breaks is the
// half you need.
//
// Deploy:  supabase functions deploy advisory-check
// Schedule: daily via pg_cron / Supabase scheduled functions (see docs/advisory-checker.md)
// Secrets: SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are injected by the platform.
//
// ── Two rules, both David's, both load-bearing ──────────────────────────────
// FREEZE ON FAILURE. A failed fetch never writes state. The previous value
// stands, with its original fetched_at, so the staleness is visible instead of a
// blank or a silent downgrade. A country we couldn't read today is NOT a country
// with no advisory.
// THE AUDIT TRAIL. Every run is logged, including the quiet ones. "What did we
// know and when did we know it" gets asked at the worst possible moment.
//
// ── Structured endpoints, never scraping ────────────────────────────────────
// State publishes a Consular Affairs API and an RSS feed; the FCDO answers
// through the GOV.UK Content API. Both bot-block a bare request, so we ask like a
// browser — but applied to a structured endpoint, not to a page that can be
// redesigned out from under us.
//
// NOTHING HERE PUBLISHES ITSELF. A detected change lands in advisory_changes as
// `pending` for a human to confirm. The site keeps showing the last confirmed
// value until someone says otherwise.

 *     one number invites a fourth.
 *   · It reports bytes and a content head, not a verdict. "Two bytes" and "an
